## Random Dot Stereogram in Unity VR (not Final)
This project aims to develop an app that displays a 3D scene in a random-dot-stereogram representation using a VR headset. The app generates a random-dot-stereogram from the 3D model of the scene and allows us to study the stereo 3D perception of human observers under dynamic conditions without any other 3D information.

### Project Overview
The Random Dot Stereogram in Unity VR project is designed to explore the stereo 3D perception of the human visual system in a psychophysical-behavioral experiment. The app developed using Unity and compatible with the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset.

The app will generate a random-dot-stereogram representation of a 3D scene, which will be displayed to the user through the VR headset. The user will then be able to navigate and explore the scene in a fully immersive VR environment.

### Features
- Generation of random-dot-stereogram from 3D model of the scene
- Compatibility with Oculus Quest 2 VR headset
- Fully immersive VR environment
- Navigation and exploration of 3D scene
### Usage
The Random Dot Stereogram in Unity VR app is intended for use in psychophysical-behavioral experiments studying stereo 3D perception. The app generates a random-dot-stereogram representation of a 3D scene, which is displayed to the user through the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Random Dot Stereogram in Unity VR project, you will need to have Unity installed on your computer and an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. Once you have both of these, you can download the project files and open them in Unity to start developing the app. Also, you can check user Documentation and final Report files for deal with issuses.
